# Weekly-Workout-Planner
Flatiron school, phase 1 project:  a SPA designed to add songs to a custom playlist. 

## Inspiration
This is an application created to practice some newly earned javascript skills to create an application to add songs to a playlist from the top 10 songs in itunes.  
The goal was to be able to easily create a playlist and access it using a simple single page application.  

CHANGE THIS TO YOUR PROJECT

 ### Select an exercise from API 
 - user can choose how to search for an exercise (exercise name, body part/region or target muscle)
 - if searching by name:
    -the dropdown list allows users to simply scroll the exercise in alphabetial order (>1,000 exercises) or they can start typing the name of an exercise to narrow the search to exercises that contain the text in the field
 - if searching by body part or target muscle:
    - upon selecting one of these a new dropdown appears to select the specific body region or target muscle once one of those are selected the main dropdown only shows exercise names that target the selected region or muscle

    ### Add the exercise to weekly calendar
 - user can add any exercise to as many week days as they would like
 - user can add custom goals to any exercise
    - ie: distance to run, repeatitions or duration on an exercise, weight and other goals that may require very specific custom input
 - once the user submits the form these exercise automatically populate into the weekly calendar and the today card (if exercise were added for that day)
 ### View daily details
 - user can view the details for any day of the week by clicking on the "view" button associated with a specific day to reveal a pop-up window with exercise details
